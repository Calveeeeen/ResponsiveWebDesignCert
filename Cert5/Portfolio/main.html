            Weclome to my portfolio. As you may or may not know, my name is Calvin Cheung. I am an aspiring Software
            Engineer that graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Physics and a Masters of Science in Software
            Development and Engineering. I always liked the idea of creating something with my hands and I also loved to
            take things apart and disect it in hopes of figuring out how it worked. This passion of mine led me to
            pursue a field in Engineering. I set my eyes on Software Engineering, because I believed that by advancing
            the software used by Health Care professionals I can help a lot of people. One way that this is possible is
            by adding consultation features to Health Care software. This was one of the problems that was solved during
            the Quarantine caused by Covid-19. I want to make this feature more accessible and advance it further in
            hopes of helping even more people.
