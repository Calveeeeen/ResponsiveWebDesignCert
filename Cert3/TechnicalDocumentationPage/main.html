                    JaveScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. It's a small and lightweight
                    language. JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                    control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extentions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form inputs, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core langugae by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provice continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript vs Java
                </h1>
                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but also different in other ways. The JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numberic, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that si, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You don't have to delcare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You don't have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you don't have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and funtion return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                    To get started with coding JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World"
                    JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>
          function greetMe(yourName){ alert("Hello " + yourName);}
          <br>
          greetMe("world")
        </code>
                <p>
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

                    Variables
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" throught "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of valid names are:
                    Number_of_Hits, temp999, and _name.

                    Declaring Variables
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variables in three ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword <em>var</em>. For example.
                </p>
                <code>
          var x = 42;
        </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example.
                </p>
                <code>
          x = 42;
        </code>
                <p>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword <em>let</em>. For example
                </p>
                <code>
          let y = 12;
        </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable Scope below.
