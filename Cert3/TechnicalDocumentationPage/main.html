                    JaveScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. It's a small and lightweight
                    language. JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                    control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extentions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form inputs, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core langugae by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provice continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
